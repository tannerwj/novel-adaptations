        At Novel Adaptations, you can review your favorite <a href="/movies">movies</a> that have been made from your favorite <a href="/books">books</a>.
        You can recommend books that have never before been made into movies to be made, as well as books that need a new movie because it's been a while
        or the other movie wasn't the best. Add new books, movies, and new movie adaptations when they come out! Review, rate, and share adaptations with your
        friends. Maybe your friends think that the movie was better than the book for some reason.
